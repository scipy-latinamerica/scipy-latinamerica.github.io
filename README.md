# How to build it

- The source code is the **gh-pages** branch.
- Install all  the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `make html` if all works as expected.
- Run `make publish` to build, copy and **push** the output to the `origin master branch`.
- The *confs_archive* folder contains static versions of the old conferences pages.
